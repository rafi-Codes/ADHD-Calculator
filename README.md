# ADHD Self-Assessment Quiz App

This is a lightweight, educational web app designed to help users reflect on common traits associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It presents a series of questions and calculates a score based on user responses — offering insight, not diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features

-  Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
-  Multiple-choice questions covering attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and organization  
-  Real-time score tracking  

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS, Java Script

## 🧠 How It Works

Users answer a series of questions like:

> *"How often do you feel restless or fidget with your hands/feet when seated?"*

Each answer maps to a score (Never = 0, Very Often = 4). The total score is used to display a feedback message such as:

- **Low score:** Few ADHD-like traits observed  
- **Moderate score:** Some traits present; consider learning more  
- **High score:** Many traits observed; consider consulting a professional
